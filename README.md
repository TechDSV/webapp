# Website vs Web Application

A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web services are Web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain Web apps.

## What is a Web Application?
A web application is a software or program which is accessible using any web browser. Its frontend is usually created using languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, which are supported by major browsers. While the backend could use any programming stack like LAMP, MEAN, etc. Unlike [mobile apps](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/mobile-web-app-development/), there is no specific SDK for developing web applications. Web Applications came to prominence with the advent of Software as a Service (SaaS) movement.

## What is a Website?
A website is hosted on a single or multiple web server. It is accessible via a network like the Internet or a private local area network via IP address.

A website is a group of globally accessible, interlinked web pages which have a single domain name. It can be developed and maintained by an individual, business or organization.

We believe that the 'web application vs website' difference not only exists but also is vital to understand clearly when you are looking for an online solution for your business. Web application development differs significantly from the development of a website. So let’s dot the I’s and find out what distinguishes these kinds of web software and which option is better for you. There are several points that draw a line between a website and a web application.

## Point 1. Authentication

Both websites and web applications may require authentication. However, for [web applications](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/web-app-development/), it is obligatory due to security reasons. Authentication is the procedure that involves entering a user’s login and password to get access to the system. User accounts must be secured to prevent unauthorized access and leakage of sensitive data.

Authentication is not obligatory for informational websites. The user may be offered to register to get access to additional options unavailable to unregistered website visitors.

## Point 2. Integration

Both websites and web applications can be integrated with other software (CRM, ERP, etc.). Still, integration is more typical for web applications, because their complex functionality often requires interaction with extra systems.

A website also can be integrated with a CRM. This allows providing users with more personalized content. However, for a website, it’s rather a rarely implemented feature than a part of the core functionality.

## Point 3. Interactivity

Similar functionality can be found in an online store that allows visitors to search through the catalog and buy items instantly. They connect users via chats and blog platforms, generate feed content based on users’ preferences and allow for almost unlimited content sharing. A typical website contains far fewer interactive elements than informational content, and the user usually spends most of the time on [web design trends](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/web-design-trends-in-2021/), viewing, or listening. The situation is the opposite with web applications, as their core functionality is based on interaction.

The interaction takes the form of a dialog: the user clicks a button or submits a form and gets a response from the page. This response may take a form of a document download, online chat, electronic payment and more.

To start ‘web application vs. website’ differentiation with is interactivity. A website provides visual and text content that the user can see and read, but not affect in any way. In the case of a [web app](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/7-awesome-web-app-ideas-for-web-developer/), the user can not only read the page content but also manipulate the data on this page. The interaction takes the form of a dialog: the user clicks a button or submits a form and gets a response from the page.

#### Disadvantages of Website
* Contact form published on your website may invite lots of unwanted spam e-mails.
* The information on any website might be unreliable if it is not updated regularly.
* A website can crash which is not good for anyone. It is the biggest disadvantage for your business.

#### Disadvantages of Web Application
* The web application is built explicitly for a certain operating system, so it is difficult to discover from the app store.
* Security is not guaranteed, so it is vulnerable for unauthorized access.
* The web app may not support multiple browsers with equal precedence.
* Limited scope to access the device's features.
